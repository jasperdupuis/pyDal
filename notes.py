TC Meeting 2022 11 14
TC   : Matt Cooke, Allison Butko
DRDC : Self (Listen only), Matt G, Layton

PROPELLER STUFF

There is design mass constrained and non constrained

first report optimization and design of both

second report (just finished) model testing for constrained

there is hope at DRDC to do testing on unconstrained as well.


Allison: What are plans for full scale?

Matt G:
1. Build viewing windows in house at ARC

2. Installation plans in/on orca vessel. En route to ABS as we speak!

3. Initially targetting April trial, will now be missed. (review process is 3-6 mths)
Now targetting PCT Moose for October trial.

Matt's money list:
fund mfg & install of windows. (DRDC, DNPS, class)

... the plot got windy here ...

Talk of ISEDC Innovation ____ Canada, IDEAS, Naval innovation something or other as faster methods of delivery.

Allison: TC still very interesting in all things QVI.

2023-2024 is the last full fiscal year of QVI.

Consider TC contract vehicles. Can't be RnD activity - service or product to help get our RnD going. 

Layton highlights ASMS EC.
Cavitation state, "marine mammal influence zone", etc.  
Coincide with Matt G's propeller trials.

Also the "el cheapo" 2-accelerometer system.

Could use the el-cheapo *or* ASMS on a BC Ferry vessel too - need a bit of measurement data to calibrate / verify transfer function.

Allison: Keep TC in mind for future QVI related initiatives.

TC: Plan to use ISC Challenge stream to do QVI design challenge.

LG Was contacted by coast guard this summer, may be coming back to the table re: quiet vessels some day.... DFO-MPO Jessica Tsai
